\## Neural Network Tech Demo



A small C++ tech demo that implements supervised learning, forward and backward propagation using gradient descent

in the example(exe):

you give it samples (expected output results for a given position red/blue).

you click learn.

it starts training to reduce the error (cost).

you can press render to see the classification for positions on the pixel grid.



Note:

\- the demo exe might not allow changing some parameters its just a review of the code.

\- there is some unused files and code in the repo.

\- you can find the executable in neural\_network\_demo\\neural\_net\_sol\\x64\\Release



\## Features

\- Dynamic network creation.

\- Multiple activation and cost functions.

\- renders the network



\## Build

you can use visual studio for build ready programme.
